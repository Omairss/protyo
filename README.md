## Problem
Detect vertical text in natural scenes.


##Strategy:
 1. Attempt implementing tried and tested OpenCV East based object recognition on regular text. (Based off the work of Tom Hoag https://bitbucket.org/tomhoag/opencv-text-detection/src/master/)
 2. Figure out best way to get it working on vertical text.
